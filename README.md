## **What is it?**
It is a Batch program that fetches the Product Key you used to activate the installation of Windows you are using.

# **How to Use**
Download a key grabber and run it with Elevated privileges, should only take about a second or two before you get your Windows Activation Key

## **Why should I get my Product Key**
Well if you want to install Windows 10 on a laptop or another desktop you can probably still use the same code on both pcs, and you don't need to pay Mr bill gates more money

## **Is it Safe**
If you don't trust me, just look at the code yourself and figure out if it is safe or not

## **What does the key look like?**
It looks like this, Blurred out for obvious reasons. Example:
```
1111-2222-AAAA-BBBB
```

## **Why does it close instantly?**
Well, it closes because it's done. You should have a file on your desktop which is called Key.txt or just Key. Open the file and there is your key

## **There are two executable files, which one should I use?**
Well the choice is yours, its the same result either way so just choose one
but if you use Windows 8 and under choose the one ending with .bat

## **Why is ***"OA3xOriginalProductKey"*** in my Key.txt file?**
