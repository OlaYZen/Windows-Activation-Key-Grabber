## **What is it?**
It is a Batch program that fetches the Product Key you used to activate the instalation of Windows you are using.

# **How to Use**
Download a keygrabber and run it with Elevated privileges, should only take about a secound or two before you get your Windows Activation Key

## **Why should i get my Product Key**
Well if you want to install Widows 10 on a laptop or another desktop you can probably still use the same code on both pcs, and you don't need to pay mr bill gates more money

## **Is it Safe**
If you don't trust me, look though the code yourself, its only two lines :/

## **What does the key look like?**
Well your code should look something like this **AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-11111-22222**

## **Why does it close instatly?**
Well it closes because its done. You should have a file on your desktop which is called Key.txt or just Key. Open the file and there is your key

## **Why is ***"OA3xOriginalProductKey"*** in my Key.txt file?**
